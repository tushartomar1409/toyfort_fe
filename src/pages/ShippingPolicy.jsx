      We dispatch all of our orders within 2-3 working days of receiving the order. We deliver the products throughout the world using our logistic partners FEDEX, DHL, and INDIAN POST. Depending on the geographic location of the customer it takes about 5 to 15 working days to deliver the product to the customer door.

      </p>

      <p className='text-gray-800 mt-4 pl-6 pr-6'>
      Our shipping policy is crystal clear and doesn’t entail hidden charges. The shipping charges which we impose are calculated online by implementing an incorporated shipping module, with our annual negotiated cut rates. The web-based quotes are estimations, which are based on weight as well as volume calculations. Our company reserves the right to change the shipping costs.
      </p>

      <p className='text-gray-800 mt-4 pl-6 pr-6'>
      All orders are transported from our India-based Warehouses. We don’t have any alliance with distributors, and we ship only from India. In shipping arrangement cases except for standard ground service, such as speedy transports, all extra charges of customs with or without brokerage will be the liability of the shopper.
      </p>

      <p className='text-gray-800 mt-4 pl-6 pr-6'>
      We at present do not involve orders to be signed when distributed.
      </p>

      <p className='text-gray-800 mt-4 pl-6 pr-6'>
      Alternative delivery methods are accessible on request; however, we take no accountability for delivery that is prearranged by our clientele. This includes the below mentioned:
      </p>

      <ul className='pl-20 mt-5 list-disc pr-6'>
        <li>Patrons using their own courier • Customers using their own shipping-account</li>
        <li>Consumers arranging for a third party to ship.</li>
        <li>If a customer decides to handle their own delivery arrangements, we need that a WAIVER must be signed. This makes certain that we aren’t responsible for any shipping concern outside our control; likewise, at the point when we receive a delivery invoice in such conditions, we are authorized to process the credit card of the customer. Please take into account that in all scenarios when payment is compulsory, a photocopy of the invoice will be forwarded along with the receipt of payment. Backorders, although rare, are not automatically dispatched. On arrival of the stock, a regular ordering rule will apply.</li>
      </ul>
